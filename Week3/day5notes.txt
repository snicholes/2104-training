stream API
	- feature of Java 8
	- the stream API is a functional-style way of defining operations on a stream
	  of elements
	- streams allow you to define operations that don't modify the input data and
	  are not executed until you tell all of them to
	- streams do not store data, they only do work on it and return new data from
	  that. basically they are generally used for filtering/analysis
	- you can combine operations then execute them all together
	- built in streams are in the java.util.stream package
	- two types of streams
		- intermediate operations: return a new stream and do not execute
		  until a terminal operation is called
		- terminal operations: trigger the execution of intermediate operations
		  to return the final data
