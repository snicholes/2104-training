Pre-setup:
	1. Find the .m2 folder on your computer. It will most likely be in the following path:
		C://Users/ZZZZZZZ/.m2
		where the ZZZZZZZ is your standard id.
	2. Place the provided settings.xml file in that folder.

Creating projects:
	* Note, all of your projects after this point will be Maven projects, not Java projects.
	1. Right-click in the Project/Package Explorer or go to File.
	2. Go to New -> Other
	3. Search for "Maven"
	4. Click on "Maven Project" then click Next
	5. Check "Create a simple project (skip archetype selection)" and click Next
	6. For "Group Id", enter "com.bofa" or "dev.yourlastname"
	7. For "Artifact Id", enter the name of your project; for example, "bike-shop"
	8. Click "Finish"

Adding dependencies:
	1. Find the pom.xml file in the project
	2. Between the line with the <version> tag and the last line, put
		<dependencies>
		</dependencies>
	3. In between those two tags, you can put your necessary dependencies.
		For example, a JUnit dependency:
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
			<artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
			<version>5.7.0-M1</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
