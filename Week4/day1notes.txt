Agile/Scrum
	- deliverable at every stage
	- MVP (minimum viable product)
	- team members are cross-functional
	- work in stories rather than application layers
		- alternatively, in the waterfall methodology,
		  the application is built layer-by-layer (for
		  example, back end to front end)
	- development is never "done"
	- Scrum
		- daily standups
		- blockers
		- stories
		- story pointing
		- burndown chart
		- sprints
		- product backlog
		- sprint backlog
	- product backlog -> sprint backlog -> in progress -> testing ->
	  peer review -> complete
Relational Database
	- a database where we store data as it relates to other data, or as
	  connections to other data. follows the relational model created by
	  E.F. Codd.
	- SQL: a language used to query, modify, and define a relational DB.
	- table: entity comprised of columns and rows, sometimes referred to
	  as "relations"
		- columns are named - same type of information. these would
		  correspond with fields of a class in Java (sometimes they
		  are actually referred to as fields)
		- rows are data entries - "complete" sets of information.
		  these would correspond with instantiated objects in Java
		  (they are sometimes referred to as records)
	- primary key: the unique identifier of a row
		- natural key: a key arising from the dataset; something
		  that is naturally a unique identifier
		- candidate key: a subset of columns that COULD be a primary
		  key; can be multiple columns, must be unique & non-nullable
		- composite key: a key comprised of multiple columns
	- candidate key conditions
		- no sensitive information (e.g. SSN, password, etc)
		- non-volatile (i.e. can't be changed) (e.g. username, email)
			- could cause orphaned fields in foreign keys
	- surrogate key
		- generated by the database then associated with the data
		- basically the opposite of a natural key, this is an
		  arbitrary value whose sole purpose is to act as the
		  primary key (usually an ID)
	- best practice regarding keys is sometimes debated, but:
		- now that memory is less of a concern, surrogate keys are
		  much safer and more practical than natural keys
		- composite keys are complicated to work with, especially
		  when connecting to Java, and even moreso when working
		  with ORM frameworks like Hibernate and SpringData which
		  are commonly used today, so they are discouraged
