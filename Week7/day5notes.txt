Selenium cont'd
	POM (page object model) design pattern
		- separates the information about the webelements into a different class
		- allows using these elements to be more clear, self-descriptive, etc.
		- easier to use for interacting with a page, especially if you interact with certain elements more than once
		- passing in the driver into the constructor so that it can be used throughout the POM
