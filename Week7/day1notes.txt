AJAX
	- asynchronous javascript and XML
	- library that allows us to send HTTP requests & receive HTTP responses 
	  and have partial page reload
		- allows us to make asynchronous calls, meaning the rest of the 
		  code can still execute while waiting for calls
			- if we send an HTTP request, event listeners can still 
			  run their callback functions while waiting for the
			  HTTP response to come back, etc.
	4 steps in making an AJAX call:
		1. create an XMLHttpRequest object
		2. set a callback function to the readystatechange event on that 
		   object
		3. open the request (this is where we set the type (GET, POST, 
		   etc.) and the URL to send the request to)
		4. send the request
	what we do in the callback function for onreadystatechange
		- check the ready state to see if we've gotten a response back
		- check the HTTP status code to see if our request was successful
		- handling the information we got back
	ready states
